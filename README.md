# microflasking

The application is an End-To-End application, so far now, the only part being implemented is only the backend of the application using the micro framework Flask.
This framework has been choosen because of the fact that I actually learning it and also because of the simplicity of the back-end of the application
that needs only to have a database (with an ORM like SQLAlchemy), a routing system (using blueprint), a serializer for passing data from client to server
and the other-way-around (using Flask-Smorest package).

## Back-end

Like said earlier, the back-end of the web application is done using Flask, and written using only what is written inside of the requirements.txt file
There will more on this later on the creation of the app
